# CRTS_PROJECT

Files needed to reproduce the analysis of CRTS errors. We compute Structure Functions for CRTS data: quasars and stars. We use quasars from the SDSS S82 quasar catalog, for which we obtain lightcurves from the CRTS DR2 database. We use stars  also  from the SDSS S82 standard stars catalog : lightcurves for 10 % randomly chosen  stars  are obtained from the CRTS DR2  (the full SDSS S82 catalog has over one  million objects).
